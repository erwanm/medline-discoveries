## medline-discoveries 

## Overview

- This is the documentation for the [Medline Discoveries repository](https://github.com/erwanm/medline-discoveries), which is the companion code for the paper "Mining impactful discoveries from the biomedical literature" **TODO link**.
- There are actually three parts in the documentation:
     - The [data collection](https://erwanm.github.io/medline-discoveries/data-collection) process describes how the input data was created.
     - The ["Detecting surges" main documentation](https://erwanm.github.io/medline-discoveries/1-detecting-surges.html) (this document) describes how to generate the output data (i.e. detecting surges) using the provided R implementation.
     - The ["Analysis" part](https://erwanm.github.io/medline-discoveries/2-analysis.html) proposes some additional analysis of the results, including how to generate the graphs and tables found in the paper.  
- The input data (Medline MeSH descriptors frequency by year) and the output data (extracted discoveries) are available at **TODO link**.
